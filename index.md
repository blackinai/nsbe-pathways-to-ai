## Pathways to AI at #NSBE45

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing and broad field that draws researchers and developers from a variety of backgrounds. In this workshop, we’ll introduce artificial intelligence, break down some related terminology, provide advice for how to get started in the field, and hear from a number of NSBE members on their paths into AI. This panel was coordinated by Black in AI, an organization formed in response to the dismal representation of the diaspora in top research venues for artificial intelligence. We’ll conclude the session with steps to take to get involved with Black in AI, a supportive community for their AI endeavors at any stage.
